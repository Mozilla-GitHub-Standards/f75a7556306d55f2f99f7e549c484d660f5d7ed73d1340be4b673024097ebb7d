#Research that Inspires: Women Inventors 
By Megan Black, Libre Learn Lab workshop participant

##Summary:
In this unit, learners will be inspired to learn more about women in STEM fields by researching and sharing their findings about informational women in STEM fields. 

##Materials:
* Internet connected device (tablet, laptop, or desktop) 
* notebook paper or note taking outline paper 
* pencils 
* poster board 
* Printer  

##Time to Complete:
* six 45-minute class periods (one additional class may be necessary due to studentsâ€™ research and typing speeds)

##Audience:
* 4th grade boys and girls (could also be done in 5th or 6th grade) 

##Background/ Intro
For my lesson: Review previous lesson where students discovered that a technology is anything that solves a problem; even a water bottle or a pencil is technology. Tie in concepts of other previous lesson about generating, sharing and building upon ones individual ideas. 

**Key Concept 1:** Technology has to be thought of, planned and created by an individual or group. Question: We use many types of technology every day. Do you know how any of those items were created? 

**Key Concept 2:** Men are not the only ones who are scientists, mathematicians and engineers. Women have made important discoveries and improvements in technology.  

**Question:** Do you know the name of any famous mathematicians, scientists, or engineers who invented something? Do you know what they invented? By show of hands, do you think of men or women as the inventors? 

##Glossary 
* inventor 
* engineer 
* scientist 
* technology 
* mathematician 

##Steps:
**Class 1**
* Students choose a science/math/engineering topic that interests them. The teacher will give them a female inventor linked to that topic. 
* Students will use a given set of websites to research and record information about their inventor 

**Class 2**
* Students finish their research 

**Class 3**
* Students type up their research 

**Class 4** 
* Students will finish typing their researching 
* Students will print a picture of their inventor 
* Students could also insert a photo into the document making a one page digital poster 
* Students could also use platforms like Glogster, Google Slides, etc. to make a digital presentation 

**Class 5**
* Students will assemble a poster of their inventor 
* Students will start presenting their posters, if time 

**Class 6**
* Students will share their presentations (in order of time their invention took place) 
* a display will be created of all of the finished projects 


##Relevant Standards
2016 Massachusetts Digital Literacy and Computer Science Frameworks 
* 3-5.CAS.a.1 Describe how to use proper ergonomics (e.g., body position, lighting, positioning of equipment, taking breaks) when using devices. 
* 3-5.CAS.b.1 Demonstrate responsible use of computers, peripheral devices, and resources as outlined in school rules (Acceptable Use Policy [AUP]). 
* 3-5.DTC.a.1 Type five words per minute times grade level. 
* 3-5.DTC.a.2 Navigate between local, networked, or online/cloud environments and transfer files between each. 
* 3-5.DTC.a.3 Use digital tools (local and online) to manipulate and publish multimedia artifacts. 
* 3-5.DTC.b.1 Communicate key ideas and details individually or collaboratively in a way that informs, persuades, and/or entertains using digital tools and media-rich resources. 
* 3-5.DTC.b.2 Collaborate through online digital tools under teacher supervision. 
* 3-5.DTC.c.1 Identify digital information sources to answer research questions (e.g., online library catalog, online encyclopedias, databases, websites). 
* 3-5.DTC.c.5 Create an artifact that answers a research question and clearly communicates thoughts and ideas. 
* 2016 Massachusetts Science, Technology and Engineering Frameworks 5.3-5-ETS3-1(MA). Use informational text to provide examples of improvements to existing technologies (innovations) and the development of new technologies (inventions). Recognize that technology is any modification of the natural or designed world done to fulfill human needs or wants.
