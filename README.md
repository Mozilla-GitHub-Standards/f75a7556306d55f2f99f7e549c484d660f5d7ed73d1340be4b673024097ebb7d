#Welcome! 

##Here you'll find instructions for Mozilla's Curriculum Design Workshop, created for for Libre Learn Lab 2016, as well as a collection of learning experiences created using the workshop format. 

**In this workshop, you'll work collaboratively to quickly conceptualize and design engaging, varied, user-centered learning experiences.**  Weâ€™ll start from a spark of an idea and and use information about our audience and a set of constraints to come up with potential iterations, then narrow options to create a very rapid, very rough prototype. Workshop products will be documented and shared online, here, in this repository.

**Time required:** This is a 1 to 1.5 hour in-person workshop

**Principles:**
* creative idea generation
* collaboration
* user-centered design
* rapid prototyping
* working open
